<p>The theme I choose for this example came from part of my frist assignment for this class, were I described how to build a personel computer. The reason why I choosed this was becasue how comfortable I was with the process from start to finish, of buildong a PC(personal computer). Also I decided to only use part of the the PC building process which was installing the video card. </p>
